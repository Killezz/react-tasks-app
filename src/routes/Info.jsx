            Making Bar chart: I was having troubles making it work and had to
            change the way data was being saved to db.json.
          </li>
          <li style={{ margin: "10px" }}>
            Tags: It took a while to make tags work. Also frequently used tags
            to get them generated from all used tags.
          </li>
          <li style={{ margin: "10px" }}>
            Features that were not done like being able to change tasks order. I
            just did not have enough time to finish these. These features would
            have required getting more knownledge like how to use react dnd and
            making it work.
